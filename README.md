## About me

I'm a Senior Software Engineer based in New Zealand focusing on back-end and data engineering. I am an avid Rustaceane 🦀 and TypeScript wizard 🧙‍♂️ but I like to take peeks into the Gophers 🌑 caves from time to time, I also come from econometrics so I have extensive Python 🐍 knowledge.
