- 👋 Hi there, my name is Afonso Barracha and I am a Cloud, ML & Back-End Developer from Portugal.
- 👀 I’m interested in NodeJS, Rust, GraphQL and Flutter.
- 🌱 I’m currently taking the OpenJS certification and learning GraphQL Back-End development with Rust and [Async-GraphQL](https://github.com/async-graphql/async-graphql).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any GraphQL project.
- 📫 You can reach me by email at: barracha.afonso@gmail.com
